   # Configure Supabase credentials
   # Run test database migrations
   ```

2. **Test Execution**:
   ```bash
   # Run all multi-organization tests
   npm test -- --testPathPatterns="multi-organization"
   
   # Run specific test suite
   npm test -- organization-switching.test.ts
   
   # Run with coverage
   npm test -- --coverage --testPathPatterns="multi-organization"
   ```

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Include in CI/CD pipeline
   - Test against staging database
   - Automated test data cleanup
   - Performance regression detection

### Conclusion

**Task 5.9 Status: ✅ COMPLETED**
