# RLS Policies Analysis - Complete Audit

## Executive Summary

After analyzing all 21 RLS policies across 10 tables, the database has **mostly good, simple policies** with a few areas for improvement. There are **no circular dependencies** (which was the major issue before), but there are some potential performance concerns and redundant policies.

## Tables and Policies Overview

### ‚úÖ GOOD - Simple, Direct Policies

#### 1. `profiles` Table (4 policies)
- **INSERT**: `auth.uid() = id` ‚úÖ Perfect
- **UPDATE**: `auth.uid() = id` ‚úÖ Perfect  
- **SELECT (own)**: `auth.uid() = id` ‚úÖ Perfect
- **SELECT (any)**: `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` ‚úÖ Good for team visibility

**Status**: Excellent - simple, direct, no circular references

#### 2. `organizations` Table (2 policies)
- **SELECT**: Uses profiles join to check organization membership ‚úÖ Good
- **UPDATE**: Admin/manager check via profiles join ‚úÖ Good

**Status**: Good - clean organization access control

#### 3. `leave_requests` Table (3 policies)
- **INSERT**: `user_id = auth.uid()` ‚úÖ Perfect
- **SELECT**: Own requests OR admin/manager in org ‚úÖ Good
- **UPDATE**: Own requests OR admin/manager in org ‚úÖ Good

**Status**: Excellent - proper user ownership + admin oversight

#### 4. `leave_types` Table (2 policies)
- **SELECT**: Organization membership check ‚úÖ Good
- **ALL**: Admin-only access ‚úÖ Good

**Status**: Good - proper admin controls

#### 5. `leave_policies` Table (1 policy)
- **ALL**: Organization membership check ‚úÖ Good

**Status**: Good - simple org-level access

### ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS ATTENTION

#### 6. `company_holidays` Table (2 policies)
- **SELECT**: `organization_id IN (SELECT...) OR (type='national' AND organization_id IS NULL)` ‚úÖ Good logic
- **ALL (admin)**: Complex admin check with national holiday exception

**Issues**: 
- Admin policy is overly complex
- Missing country filtering for national holidays

#### 7. `leave_balances` Table (2 policies)
- **SELECT**: Complex nested queries with multiple role checks
- **ALL**: Very complex admin access with nested subqueries

**Issues**: 
- Multiple nested subqueries could be performance bottlenecks
- Overly complex logic could be simplified

### üî¥ PERFORMANCE CONCERNS

#### 8. `employee_schedules` Table (1 policy)
```sql
user_id IN (
  SELECT profiles.id FROM profiles 
  WHERE profiles.organization_id = (
    SELECT profiles_1.organization_id FROM profiles profiles_1 
    WHERE profiles_1.id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```
**Issues**: 
- Double profiles table query (inefficient)
- Could be simplified significantly

#### 9. `schedule_exceptions` Table (1 policy)
- Same pattern as employee_schedules - double profiles query

#### 10. `work_schedules` Table (1 policy)
- Same pattern as employee_schedules - double profiles query

#### 11. `work_schedule_templates` Table (1 policy)
- Uses organization membership check (better than above)

## Detailed Issues Analysis

### 1. Redundant Profile Queries

**Problem**: Several policies use this inefficient pattern:
```sql
user_id IN (
  SELECT profiles.id FROM profiles 
  WHERE profiles.organization_id = (
    SELECT profiles_1.organization_id FROM profiles profiles_1 
    WHERE profiles_1.id = auth.uid()
  )
)
```

**Solution**: Simplify to:
```sql
user_id IN (
  SELECT id FROM profiles 
  WHERE organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
)
```

**Affected Tables**: `employee_schedules`, `schedule_exceptions`, `work_schedules`

### 2. Complex Leave Balances Policies

**Current Policy**:
```sql
(user_id = auth.uid()) OR (user_id IN ( 
  SELECT profiles.id FROM profiles 
  WHERE (profiles.organization_id = ( 
    SELECT profiles_1.organization_id FROM profiles profiles_1 
    WHERE (profiles_1.id = auth.uid())
  )) 
  AND (auth.uid() IN ( 
    SELECT profiles_1.id FROM profiles profiles_1 
    WHERE ((profiles_1.role)::text = ANY ((ARRAY['admin'::character varying, 'manager'::character varying])::text[]))
  ))
))
```

**Issues**:
- Triple nested queries
- Redundant auth.uid() checks
- Performance concerns

**Recommended Simplification**:
```sql
user_id = auth.uid() 
OR EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM profiles 
  WHERE id = auth.uid() 
  AND role IN ('admin', 'manager')
  AND organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = user_id)
)
```

### 3. Missing Country Filtering in Holidays

**Current National Holiday Logic**:
```sql
(type='national' AND organization_id IS NULL)
```

**Issue**: Shows ALL national holidays regardless of organization's country

**Recommended Fix**:
```sql
(type='national' AND organization_id IS NULL AND country_code = (
  SELECT country_code FROM organizations 
  WHERE id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
))
```

### 4. Redundant Profile Policies

**Current**: Two SELECT policies on profiles table:
- `auth.uid() = id` (own profile)
- `auth.role() = 'authenticated'` (any profile)

**Issue**: The second policy makes the first redundant

**Recommendation**: Keep only the broader policy or add organization filtering

## Custom Functions Analysis

### ‚úÖ Safe Functions
- `calculate_easter` - Pure mathematical function ‚úÖ
- `generate_invitation_code` - Simple utility ‚úÖ
- `calculate_working_days_with_holidays` - Complex but safe ‚úÖ

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Potentially Risky Functions
- `get_user_organization_id` - Simple SELECT, safe but could be inlined ‚úÖ
- `is_admin_in_organization` - Safe helper function ‚úÖ
- `calculate_leave_allocation` - Complex business logic but safe ‚úÖ

### üî¥ Legacy/Unused Functions
Several trigger functions and test functions that may not be actively used.

## Priority Recommendations

### High Priority (Performance)
1. **Simplify schedule-related policies** - Replace double profile queries
2. **Optimize leave_balances policies** - Reduce nested queries
3. **Add country filtering to holidays** - Prevent showing wrong country holidays

### Medium Priority (Maintenance)
1. **Consolidate profile SELECT policies** - Remove redundancy
2. **Simplify company_holidays admin policy** - Reduce complexity
3. **Review and remove unused functions** - Clean up database

### Low Priority (Future)
1. **Add proper indexing** for policy performance
2. **Consider using views** for complex organization checks
3. **Document policy intentions** in comments

## Security Assessment

### ‚úÖ Strong Security
- No circular dependencies found
- User isolation properly implemented
- Admin/manager roles properly protected
- Proper organization boundaries maintained

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Minor Concerns
- Very permissive profile viewing (any authenticated user)
- Some policies could be more restrictive

## Performance Assessment

### üî¥ Performance Issues
- Multiple policies use nested subqueries that could be optimized
- Schedule-related policies are particularly inefficient
- Leave balances policies have unnecessary complexity

### ‚úÖ Good Performance
- Simple ownership checks (profiles, leave_requests) are efficient
- Basic organization membership checks are reasonable
- No obvious N+1 query patterns in policies

## Recommended Policy Improvements

### 1. Employee Schedules (URGENT)
```sql
-- CURRENT (inefficient)
user_id IN (SELECT profiles.id FROM profiles WHERE profiles.organization_id = (SELECT profiles_1.organization_id FROM profiles profiles_1 WHERE profiles_1.id = auth.uid()))

-- RECOMMENDED  
user_id IN (SELECT id FROM profiles WHERE organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()))
```

### 2. Company Holidays (HIGH)
```sql
-- Add country filtering to national holidays
(organization_id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid()))
OR (type = 'national' AND organization_id IS NULL AND country_code = (
  SELECT country_code FROM organizations 
  WHERE id = (SELECT organization_id FROM profiles WHERE id = auth.uid())
))
```

### 3. Leave Balances (MEDIUM)
```sql
-- Simplify admin/manager check
user_id = auth.uid() 
OR EXISTS (
  SELECT 1 FROM profiles p1, profiles p2
  WHERE p1.id = auth.uid() 
  AND p1.role IN ('admin', 'manager')
  AND p2.id = user_id
  AND p1.organization_id = p2.organization_id
)
```

## Conclusion

The RLS policies are **fundamentally sound** with no security vulnerabilities or circular dependencies. The main issues are **performance optimizations** and **minor logic improvements**. The database is in much better shape than during the previous optimization disaster.

**Key Takeaways**:
1. ‚úÖ Security is solid - no major vulnerabilities
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è Performance can be improved with simpler queries  
3. ‚úÖ No circular dependencies or infinite recursion risks
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Some policies are overly complex and could be simplified
5. ‚úÖ Organization isolation is properly maintained

**Recommendation**: Implement the performance optimizations gradually, testing each change thoroughly in development first.
