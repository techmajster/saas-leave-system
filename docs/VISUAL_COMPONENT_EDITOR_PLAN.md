## 🎨 User Experience Flow

### 1. Enable Edit Mode
- Toggle edit mode from design system or main app
- Visual indicators appear on all editable components
- Floating toolbar with editing controls

### 2. Select Component
- Click on any component to select it
- Component highlights with selection border
- Properties panel slides in from right

### 3. Edit Properties
- Real-time property changes with live preview
- Validation and constraints enforcement
- Visual feedback for changes

### 4. Save Changes
- Changes auto-save or manual save
- Sync back to design system
- Propagate to all instances

---

## 🔧 Technical Considerations

### Performance
- Efficient component tracking and registration
- Minimal overhead when edit mode is disabled
- Optimized re-rendering for property changes
- Lazy loading of editor components

### Security
- Permission-based editing access
- Change audit logging
- Rollback capabilities
- Secure API endpoints

### Scalability
- Support for large component trees
- Efficient change propagation
- Modular editor architecture
- Plugin system for custom editors

---

## 📊 Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Time to edit component properties: < 10 seconds
- Visual feedback latency: < 100ms
- Edit mode toggle responsiveness: < 200ms

### Technical Performance
- Edit mode overhead: < 5% performance impact
- Component registration time: < 50ms per component
- Change propagation: < 1 second

### Adoption
- Designer usage frequency
- Developer integration rate
- Component edit success rate
