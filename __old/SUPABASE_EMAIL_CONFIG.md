# Supabase Email Configuration

## ✅ Step 7: Disable Supabase Default Email Confirmations

Since we've implemented a custom email verification system using Resend, we need to disable Supabase's default email confirmations to prevent conflicts.

### 🔧 Configuration Steps:

#### For Supabase Cloud (Dashboard):

1. **Go to your Supabase Dashboard**
   - Navigate to your project at https://supabase.com/dashboard

2. **Access Authentication Settings**
   - Click on "Authentication" in the left sidebar
   - Go to "Settings" tab

3. **Disable Email Confirmations**
   - Find "Enable email confirmations" setting
   - **Turn OFF** this toggle
   - Keep "Enable sign ups" **ON**

4. **Save Settings**
   - Click "Save" to apply changes

#### For Self-Hosted Supabase:

Add these environment variables to your Supabase configuration:

```bash
GOTRUE_MAILER_AUTOCONFIRM=true
GOTRUE_ENABLE_SIGNUP=true
```

### ✅ Verification:

After making these changes:

1. **Test signup flow** - users should NOT receive Supabase confirmation emails
2. **Only our custom verification emails** should be sent via Resend
3. **Check that signup still works** with our custom flow

### 📋 What This Prevents:

- **Email conflicts** - users won't get two different verification emails
- **Confusion** - users won't wonder which email to use
- **State inconsistencies** - prevents Supabase and custom systems from conflicting

### 🔍 Current Configuration Status:

You can check the current configuration by running this query in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
SELECT * FROM public.system_config 
WHERE config_key LIKE '%email%' OR config_key LIKE '%signup%';
```

### 🚨 Important Notes:

- **Apply the migration first** before changing dashboard settings
- **Test the signup flow** after making changes
- **Monitor for any issues** in the first few signups
- **Keep "Enable sign ups" ON** - we still want users to be able to register

### 🔄 Rollback (if needed):

If you need to rollback:
1. Re-enable "Enable email confirmations" in Supabase Dashboard
2. Temporarily disable our custom verification endpoints
3. Test that Supabase emails work again
