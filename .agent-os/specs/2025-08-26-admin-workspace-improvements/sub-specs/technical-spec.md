# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-26-admin-workspace-improvements/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-26
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### Workspace Deletion Feature
- Add new "Workspace" tab to admin settings interface at /admin/settings
- Implement delete workspace button with confirmation dialog
- Create workspace deletion logic that removes all associated data (employees, absences, invitations)
- Add proper error handling and success notifications
- Ensure RLS (Row Level Security) compliance for data deletion
- Redirect user to appropriate page after workspace deletion

### Balance Initialization Fix
- Modify workspace creation logic to automatically assign default absence balance to creator
- Use existing default balance constant (25 days) that applies to invited users
- Update user balance initialization in workspace creation flow
- Ensure balance is set immediately upon workspace creation completion

### Onboarding Language Support
- Extend existing i18n system to onboarding components
- Add language detection and application for onboarding screens
- Integrate with existing translation system used in registration/login
- Support same languages already available in auth flows
- Maintain language preference across onboarding steps

### UI Enhancement for Onboarding
- Add CSS cursor: pointer to all interactive buttons in onboarding screens
- Apply hover states consistently across onboarding components
- Update button styling to include hand cursor on hover
- Ensure cursor changes apply to all clickable elements in onboarding flow

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy
- Leverage existing admin interface patterns for workspace tab addition
- Use current user balance initialization patterns from invitation system
- Extend existing i18n configuration to cover onboarding components
- Apply consistent CSS patterns for cursor states across UI components

### Data Safety Considerations
- Implement cascading deletion with proper foreign key constraints
- Add confirmation dialogs before destructive workspace operations
- Ensure proper cleanup of all workspace-related data
- Maintain referential integrity during deletion process
