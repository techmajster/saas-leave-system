> Spec: Admin Workspace Improvements
> Created: 2025-08-26
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement four administrative improvements to enhance workspace management and user onboarding experience. These changes will improve workspace lifecycle management, ensure consistent user balance initialization, add language support to onboarding flows, and enhance UI interactions.

## User Stories

### Admin Workspace Management

As a workspace administrator, I want to delete my workspace from the admin settings, so that I can properly clean up workspaces that are no longer needed.

The admin can navigate to /admin/settings, access a new "Workspace" tab, and find a delete workspace option that safely removes the workspace and all associated data with proper confirmation dialogs.

### Consistent User Balance Initialization

As a workspace creator, I want to receive the same default absence balance as newly invited users, so that all workspace members start with consistent leave allocations.

When creating a new workspace, the creator's absence balance should be automatically set to match the default balance that newly invited users receive (currently 25 days).

### Multilingual Onboarding Support

As a user going through onboarding, I want the interface to support multiple languages (like registration and login), so that I can complete the process in my preferred language.

The onboarding screens should detect and use the same language support system that's already implemented for registration and login flows.

### Enhanced Onboarding UI Interactions

As a user navigating onboarding screens, I want buttons to show a hand cursor on hover, so that the interface feels more interactive and intuitive.

All interactive elements in the onboarding flow should display appropriate cursor states to improve user experience consistency.

## Spec Scope

1. **Workspace Deletion Feature** - Add delete workspace functionality to admin settings with proper confirmation and data cleanup
2. **Balance Initialization Fix** - Ensure workspace creators receive default absence balance matching invited users
3. **Onboarding Language Support** - Extend existing language support to onboarding screens
4. **Onboarding Cursor Enhancement** - Add hand cursor hover states to onboarding buttons

## Out of Scope

- Changes to core absence balance calculation logic
- Modifications to existing language translation system
- Updates to other admin interface sections beyond workspace management
- Bulk workspace operations or advanced workspace management features

## Expected Deliverable

1. Admin settings page contains new "Workspace" tab with delete functionality that successfully removes workspace and data
2. New workspace creators automatically receive default absence balance matching invited user allocation
3. Onboarding screens display in user's selected language using existing translation system
4. All onboarding buttons show hand cursor on hover providing consistent interactive feedback
