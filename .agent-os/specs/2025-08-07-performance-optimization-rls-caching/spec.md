> Spec: Performance Optimization - RLS Policy Improvements and Caching
> Created: 2025-08-07
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Optimize system performance through RLS policy improvements, caching strategies, database query optimization, and performance monitoring implementation. This optimization work will improve user experience by reducing page load times and query response times across the multi-organization leave management platform.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Performance Monitoring

As a system administrator, I want to monitor application performance metrics, so that I can proactively identify and resolve performance bottlenecks before they impact users.

The administrator can access a performance dashboard showing key metrics like page load times, database query performance, RLS policy execution times, and cache hit rates. They receive alerts when performance degrades beyond acceptable thresholds.

### Team Manager Fast Data Access

As a team manager, I want leave request data to load quickly when viewing team calendars and reports, so that I can efficiently review and approve requests without waiting for slow queries.

The manager experiences fast loading times when accessing team leave data, with intelligent caching ensuring frequently accessed data is readily available while maintaining data consistency across the multi-organization system.

### Employee Quick Leave Submission

As an employee, I want the leave request form and calendar to load instantly, so that I can quickly submit requests and view team availability without delays.

The employee sees immediate responses when navigating between calendar views, submitting forms, and checking leave balances, with optimized RLS policies ensuring secure but fast data access.

## Spec Scope

1. **RLS Policy Optimization** - Analyze and improve existing Row Level Security policies to reduce query complexity and execution time
2. **Caching Implementation** - Implement intelligent caching strategies for frequently accessed data using React Query and server-side caching
3. **Database Query Optimization** - Add appropriate indexes and optimize slow queries identified through performance analysis
4. **Performance Monitoring** - Implement comprehensive performance monitoring with metrics collection and alerting

## Out of Scope

- Frontend UI changes or redesigns
- New feature development beyond performance improvements  
- Database schema changes beyond indexes
- Infrastructure scaling or server upgrades

## Expected Deliverable

1. Measurably faster page load times and query response times across the application
2. Performance monitoring dashboard showing key metrics and alerts for degradation
3. Optimized RLS policies with reduced complexity and faster execution
