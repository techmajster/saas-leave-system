# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-07-performance-optimization-rls-caching/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### RLS Policy Optimization
- Audit existing RLS policies in Supabase to identify complex or inefficient rules
- Simplify policy logic where possible while maintaining security boundaries
- Add database indexes to support RLS policy filtering conditions
- Implement policy caching strategies where appropriate
- Test RLS policy performance with realistic data volumes

### Caching Implementation
- Enhance React Query configuration for optimal client-side caching
- Implement server-side caching for frequently accessed data using Next.js revalidation
- Configure Supabase caching strategies for read-heavy operations
- Add cache invalidation logic for data consistency in multi-org environment
- Implement cache warming for critical user data

### Database Query Optimization
- Analyze slow query logs to identify bottlenecks
- Add composite indexes for multi-column filtering (organization_id, date ranges, user roles)
- Optimize join queries between organizations, users, and leave requests
- Implement query result pagination for large datasets
- Add database connection pooling optimization

### Performance Monitoring
- Integrate Vercel Analytics for real user monitoring
- Implement custom performance metrics collection using Web Vitals
- Add database query performance tracking using Supabase monitoring
- Create performance alerts for degraded response times
- Build performance dashboard for system administrators

### Integration Requirements
- Maintain compatibility with existing Supabase Auth flows
- Ensure multi-organization data isolation remains secure
- Preserve existing API contracts while optimizing underlying performance
- Support both Polish and English internationalization without performance impact
