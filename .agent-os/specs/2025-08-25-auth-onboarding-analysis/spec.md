# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Authentication & Onboarding System Analysis
> Created: 2025-08-25
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Conduct a comprehensive analysis of the completed authentication, sign-in, and onboarding system to validate functionality, document current state, and ensure all flows work correctly across different user scenarios and edge cases.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Story

As a system administrator, I want to validate that our authentication and onboarding flows are working correctly across all scenarios, so that I can be confident in the system's reliability and user experience.

This includes verifying that users can successfully sign up through invitations, create workspaces, join existing organizations, and complete onboarding flows without encountering broken states or security issues.

### New User Story

As a new user receiving an invitation, I want to understand all possible paths through the onboarding system, so that the analysis covers every scenario I might encounter including edge cases.

This includes invitation acceptance, workspace creation, organization joining, welcome flows, and handling of expired or invalid invitations.

### Development Team Story

As a development team member, I want comprehensive documentation of our authentication system's current state, so that future development and maintenance can be performed efficiently.

This includes technical implementation details, security considerations, integration points, and identified areas for improvement.

## Spec Scope

1. **Complete Authentication Flow Analysis** - Document and test all authentication paths including sign-up, sign-in, Google OAuth, and session management
2. **Onboarding Process Validation** - Verify all onboarding scenarios including welcome flows, workspace creation, and organization joining
3. **Invitation System Review** - Test invitation creation, sending, acceptance, and edge case handling
4. **Multi-Organization Support Analysis** - Validate organization switching, isolation, and permission handling
5. **Security Implementation Audit** - Review RLS policies, authentication flows, and data protection measures
6. **User Experience Flow Documentation** - Map all user journeys and identify potential friction points
7. **Edge Case and Error Handling Review** - Test and document handling of invalid states, expired tokens, and error scenarios

## Out of Scope

- Performance testing and load analysis
- UI/UX redesign recommendations
- New feature development
- Database schema changes
- Third-party integrations beyond existing OAuth

## Expected Deliverable

1. Complete functional analysis report documenting all authentication and onboarding flows with test results
2. Technical implementation documentation covering components, APIs, and database interactions
3. Security analysis report identifying current protections and any potential vulnerabilities
4. User journey maps for all onboarding scenarios with identified friction points
5. Edge case handling documentation with test results and recommendations
6. Comprehensive system state documentation serving as a reference for future development
