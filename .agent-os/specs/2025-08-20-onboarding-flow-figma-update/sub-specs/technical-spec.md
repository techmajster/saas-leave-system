# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-20-onboarding-flow-figma-update/spec.md

> Created: 2025-08-20
> Version: 1.0.0

## Technical Requirements

### UI Component Requirements
- Update OnboardingPage components to render 4 distinct scenarios based on API response
- Create WorkspaceAvatar component with circular design, initials extraction, and member count badge
- Implement responsive layouts matching Figma designs (24697-216103, 24689-24777, 24689-24716, 24748-1751)
- Add proper loading states during organization status checks
- Ensure proper navigation between onboarding screens

### API Integration Requirements
- Enhance /api/user/organization-status endpoint to return structured data for all 4 scenarios
- Maintain compatibility with existing /api/auth/signup-with-invitation endpoint
- Add proper error handling for organization status failures
- Implement client-side routing logic based on organization status response

### Frontend Logic Requirements
- Create scenario detection logic based on organization status API response
- Implement workspace selection handling for multiple workspace scenarios
- Add invitation acceptance flow integration
- Ensure proper state management during onboarding process
- Handle edge cases (loading states, API failures, invalid invitations)

### Styling Requirements
- Match exact Figma designs for all 4 scenarios using TailwindCSS
- Implement circular workspace avatars with proper initials and member count styling
- Ensure responsive design across desktop and mobile breakpoints
- Maintain design consistency with existing application theme
- Add proper hover states and interactive elements

### Performance Requirements
- Minimize API calls during onboarding flow
- Implement proper caching for organization status checks
- Ensure fast page transitions between onboarding screens
- Optimize workspace avatar rendering for multiple workspace scenarios

## Approach

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start by enhancing the /api/user/organization-status endpoint to return comprehensive scenario data
2. Update onboarding page components to consume new API response structure
3. Create reusable WorkspaceAvatar component matching Figma specifications
4. Implement scenario-specific UI components for each of the 4 onboarding flows
5. Add proper routing and navigation logic between onboarding screens
6. Integrate with existing invitation acceptance endpoint without modifications

### Component Architecture
- OnboardingPage: Main container handling scenario routing
- WelcomeScreen: Scenario 1 implementation
- ChoiceScreen: Scenario 2 implementation  
- MultiOptionScreen: Scenario 3 implementation
- InvitationRegistration: Scenario 4 implementation (uses existing flow)
- WorkspaceAvatar: Reusable component for workspace display
- WorkspaceCard: Container for workspace selection with avatar and details

### State Management
- Use React hooks for local onboarding state management
- Implement proper loading states during API calls
- Handle error states gracefully with user-friendly messages
- Maintain invitation tokens and workspace selection state between screens
