> Spec: Theme Editor Removal
> Created: 2025-08-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Remove outdated theme editor infrastructure and visual component editor system that are no longer needed, cleaning up deprecated design system components and documentation while preserving essential theme functionality for the production application.

## User Stories

### Admin Cleanup Story

As a system administrator, I want to remove deprecated theme editor components, so that the codebase is cleaner and doesn't contain confusing or broken functionality that could mislead developers.

**Detailed Workflow**: The admin notices that there are extensive theme editor plans and components in the codebase that were never fully implemented, along with backup components from July 2024 that are no longer relevant. These need to be safely removed without breaking the core application functionality.

### Developer Maintenance Story

As a developer, I want to clean up deprecated design system components and documentation, so that I can focus on the current architecture without being distracted by outdated plans and broken implementations.

**Detailed Workflow**: The developer reviews the codebase and identifies multiple layers of theme-related functionality: some that should be preserved (basic theme provider and mode toggle), some that should be removed (visual component editor plans), and some that needs evaluation (backup components and extensive documentation).

## Spec Scope

1. **Remove Visual Component Editor Infrastructure** - Delete all planned but unimplemented visual editor components and documentation
2. **Clean Up Backup Components** - Remove outdated component backups from July 2024 that are no longer needed
3. **Preserve Essential Theme Functionality** - Keep working ThemeProvider and ModeToggle components that are actively used
4. **Remove Deprecated Documentation** - Clean up extensive design system documentation that refers to unimplemented features
5. **Update Admin Components Page** - Ensure the ComponentsShowcase remains functional after cleanup

## Out of Scope

- Removing the basic theme system (ThemeProvider, ModeToggle) that is actively used in the application
- Modifying the core UI component library (shadcn/ui components)
- Changing the current light/dark theme functionality that works in production
- Removing valid backup files that might be needed for recovery

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Clean Codebase** - All deprecated theme editor and visual component editor files removed
2. **Functional Theme System** - Basic theme switching functionality preserved and working
3. **Updated Documentation** - Only relevant documentation remains, outdated plans removed
