# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-theme-editor-removal/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

### File System Cleanup
- **Remove Visual Component Editor Documentation**: Delete VISUAL_COMPONENT_EDITOR_PLAN.md and related design system implementation documentation
- **Remove Backup Component Directory**: Delete entire components_backup_20250714_184449/ directory and its contents
- **Clean Design System Documentation**: Remove outdated design system documentation files that reference unimplemented features
- **Preserve Essential Theme Components**: Keep /components/theme-provider.tsx and /components/mode-toggle.tsx which are actively used

### Component Analysis and Preservation
- **Analyze Component Dependencies**: Use grep to identify which components are actually imported and used in the application
- **Preserve Working UI Components**: Ensure ComponentsShowcase.tsx continues to function without any missing dependencies
- **Validate Theme Provider Usage**: Confirm ThemeProvider is properly integrated in app/layout.tsx and remains functional
- **Test Mode Toggle Integration**: Ensure ModeToggle component works correctly after cleanup

### Documentation Cleanup Strategy
- **Remove Implementation Plans**: Delete docs files that contain plans for unimplemented features
- **Keep Reference Documentation**: Preserve documentation that describes current working features
- **Clean Backup Documentation**: Remove snapshot and backup documentation files that are no longer relevant
- **Update Component References**: Ensure no documentation refers to deleted components or files

### Safety Measures
- **Dependency Check Before Deletion**: Use grep/ripgrep to search for imports of files before deleting them
- **Preserve Active Imports**: Never delete files that are actively imported by working code
- **Validate Application Still Builds**: Ensure the application builds and runs successfully after each cleanup step
- **Preserve Git History**: Use git commands to track what was removed for potential rollback
