# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Multi-Organization Migration Fixes
> Created: 2025-08-05
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Systematically identify and resolve all remaining functional regressions introduced by the multi-organization architecture migration to restore full application functionality across admin and regular user experiences.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Recovery

As a system administrator, I want all admin panel functionality to work correctly after the multi-org migration, so that I can manage teams, employees, and organizational settings without encountering errors or broken features.

**Detailed Workflow:** Admin users should be able to access all team management features, edit employee details, manage leave balances, configure organizational settings, and perform bulk operations without encountering RLS policy violations or UI component failures.

### Manager Experience Restoration

As a team manager, I want to select team members, approve leave requests, and view team schedules without encountering empty states or selection errors, so that I can effectively manage my team's leave planning.

**Detailed Workflow:** Managers should see populated team member lists, be able to assign managers to groups, access leave request approval workflows, and view comprehensive team availability without hardcoded placeholder data.

### Employee Self-Service Recovery

As an employee, I want to view my accurate leave balances, submit leave requests, and see my team information correctly displayed, so that I can manage my time off effectively.

**Detailed Workflow:** Employees should see their actual leave balances from the database, successfully submit and track leave requests, view their assigned teams and managers, and receive proper notifications for leave status changes.

## Spec Scope

1. **RLS Policy Audit & Fix** - Identify and resolve all Row Level Security policy violations preventing data access
2. **Admin Panel Functionality Restoration** - Fix all broken admin features including employee management and team operations
3. **UI Component Fixes** - Replace native browser dialogs with custom UI components and fix empty state handling
4. **Data Display Corrections** - Replace hardcoded values with dynamic database queries for leave balances and team information
5. **Manager Selection & Assignment** - Restore proper manager selection functionality across all team management interfaces

## Out of Scope

- New feature development beyond fixing regression issues
- Performance optimizations unrelated to functional fixes
- UI/UX improvements that are not directly fixing broken functionality
- Migration rollback procedures
- Data migration validation tools

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Fully Functional Admin Panel** - All team management, employee editing, and organizational settings work without errors
2. **Restored Manager Workflows** - Manager selection, team assignment, and approval processes function correctly
3. **Accurate Data Display** - All leave balances, team information, and employee details show current database values rather than placeholder data
