# Technical Specification

This is the technical specification for the spec detailed in @.agent-os/specs/2025-08-05-database-cleanup/spec.md

## Technical Requirements

- **Database Analysis Tools** - Use SQL queries and analysis scripts to identify obsolete tables and unused artifacts
- **Safe Removal Process** - Implement step-by-step removal process with rollback capability for each cleanup operation
- **Migration Consolidation** - Review and consolidate redundant or unused migration files while preserving migration history
- **RLS Policy Optimization** - Review and optimize Row Level Security policies for better performance
- **Index Optimization** - Analyze and remove unnecessary indexes while preserving performance-critical ones
- **Foreign Key Validation** - Ensure all foreign key relationships remain intact after cleanup
- **Application Testing Interface** - Provide comprehensive testing checklist to validate functionality after each cleanup step
- **Backup Strategy** - Create database backup before any destructive operations
- **Rollback Procedures** - Document rollback procedures for each cleanup operation
- **Performance Monitoring** - Measure database performance before and after cleanup operations

## Database Cleanup Scope

### Tables to Analyze for Removal
- **parental_leave_requests** - Already removed in migration but verify complete cleanup
- **migration_logs** - Evaluate if historical migration logs can be archived or removed
- **Backup tables** - Remove any tables with '_backup' suffix after validation
- **Unused multi-org tables** - Review join_requests, organization_domains if not fully implemented
- **Legacy auth tables** - Clean up any unused authentication-related tables

### Migration Files to Review
- **Consolidation candidates** - Small migrations that could be combined for cleaner history
- **Failed migrations** - Remove migration files that were rolled back or superseded
- **Development artifacts** - Remove migrations created during development but not used in production
- **Multi-org migration files** - Consolidate the multi-organization migration files if appropriate

### Database Optimization Areas
- **Unused indexes** - Remove indexes on columns that are no longer queried
- **Redundant constraints** - Identify and remove duplicate or unnecessary constraints
- **RLS policy simplification** - Optimize complex RLS policies for better performance
- **Function cleanup** - Remove unused database functions from migration artifacts

## Validation Requirements

- **Data integrity checks** - Verify all foreign key relationships remain valid
- **Application functionality tests** - Test all major application features after each cleanup step
- **Performance benchmarking** - Measure query performance before and after optimization
- **RLS policy validation** - Ensure all security policies continue to function correctly
- **Migration history integrity** - Preserve essential migration history for audit purposes
